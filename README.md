## Back End of the Line
An E-Commerce Back End Project. 

## About

As stated above, this is an E-Commerce Back End Server that I attempted to create with supplied starter code. Much was learned and exhausted throughout this including making models with sequelize, the relationships built to to connect those models and utilizing the post, put, get, and delete routs to create, update, delete or simply view tables and columns on the local server, which I admittedly had some trouble with. The schema creates the database that said tables are put into, seed the index file to display and poulate the tables with the models. Finally, running the 3001 server port provides access to them. 

## My Task

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.
